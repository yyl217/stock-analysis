## Overview of Project

### Background

The green_stocks.xlsx is an excel file that contains a dataset of the stocks with tickers, date, pricing, and volume details. 

### Purpose

This project aims to summarize the green_stocks.xlsx with a simple click of the button and a preliminary analysis of the generated summary.

## Summary

For the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" analysis, we can see a spike of successful cases between May and June. This shows that there could be a potential increase in probably if one fundraising event starts between May and Jun. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that human activity increase during the summertime because of the warmer weather and longer day time. More people were able to participate in fundraising events. However, the dataset only has 1369 rows of data for theater, which is relatively small, and such a phenomenon could just be random events.

For the "Outcomes Based on Goal," we can see that the overall trend for successful rate goes down as the goal dollar amount increases, and fail rate goes down as the goal dollar amount increases. We can also see that the canceration rate also increases as the dollar amount increases, but not as dramatically as the success and failure rate. Based on the graph, we can conclude that as the dollar-amount increases, the fundraiser will be less likely to be successful. The potential explanation is that it is inherently harder to gather a large amount of the fund.
